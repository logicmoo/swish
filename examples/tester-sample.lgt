%  This is a sample tester file. Tester files are simply Logtalk source files
%  whose main purpose is to load and run your application unit tests. Usually
%  they contain just a Prolog initialization/1 directive wrapping Logtalk goals
%  as exemplified below.
%
%  The provided testing automation shell script, "logtalk_tester", looks for
%  files named either "tester.lgt" or "tester.logtalk" in the current directory
%  and its sub-directories when run.


:- initialization((
	% minimize compilation reports to the essential ones
	set_logtalk_flag(report, warnings),
	% load any necessary library files; for example:
	% logtalk_load(library(basic_types_loader)),
	% load the unit test tool
	logtalk_load(lgtunit(loader)),
	% load your application files (e.g. "source.lgt") enabling supporting for
	% code coverage, which requires compilation in debug mode and collecting
	% source data information; if code coverage is not wanted, simply remove
	% the "debug(on)" option for faster execution
	logtalk_load(source, [source_data(on), debug(on)]),
	% compile the unit tests file expanding it using "lgtunit" as the hook
	% object to preprocess the tests
	logtalk_load(tests, [hook(lgtunit)]),
	% run all the unit tests
	tests::run
)).
