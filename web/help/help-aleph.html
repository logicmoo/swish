  <p>
   Porting of Aleph for SWI-Prolog.
  </p>
  <p>
   Aleph is an Inductive Logic Programming system developed by
   <a href="https://www.iiitd.edu.in/~ashwin/">
    Ashwin Srinivasan
   </a>
   :
  </p>
  <p>
   <a href="http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/activities/machlearn/Aleph/">
    http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/activities/machlearn/Aleph/
   </a>
  </p>
  <p>
   This pack contains a porting of Aleph v.5 to SWI-Prolog. The porting
   was done by
   <a href="http://ds.ing.unife.it/~friguzzi/">
    Fabrizio Riguzzi
   </a>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Two files are included: aleph_orig.pl is a direct porting of Aleph for Yap,
   while aleph.pl
   is modoule-file that can run also under SWISH.
   aleph.pl was developed by Paolo Niccol√≤ Giubelli.
  </p>
  <h2 id="usage">
   Usage
  </h2>
  <p>
   aleph_orig.pl can be used as the original Aleph.
  </p>
  <p>
   aleph.pl differs because it uses a single input
   file instead of three files for background,
   positive and negative examples.
  </p>
  <p>
   The input file for aleph.pl must be

   structured as follows:
  </p>
  <p>
    <h3 id="usage-module-loading">

</code></pre>
  <p>
    <h3 id="usage-end">

   <br/>
   The file must contain the following directive at the end:

  <p>
   You can start the induction process by calling the
   <em>
    induce/1
   </em>
   predicate, which returns the theory as a list of clauses.
   <em>

<P>
This document provides reference information on <STRONG>A</STRONG>
<STRONG>L</STRONG>earning <STRONG>E</STRONG>ngine for <STRONG>P</STRONG>roposing
<STRONG>H</STRONG>ypotheses (Aleph).
Aleph is an Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) system.
This manual is not intended to be a tutorial on ILP.  A good
introduction to the theory, implementation and applications of ILP can
be found in S.H. Muggleton and L. De Raedt (1994), <EM>Inductive Logic
Programming: Theory and Methods</EM>, Jnl. Logic Programming,
19,20:629--679, available at
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.york.ac.uk/pub/ML_GROUP/Papers/lpj.ps.gz">ftp://ftp.cs.york.ac.uk/pub/ML_GROUP/Papers/lpj.ps.gz</A>.  <BR>


<P>
Aleph is intended to be a prototype for exploring ideas. Earlier
incarnations (under the name P-Progol) originated in 1993
as part of a fun project undertaken by Ashwin Srinivasan and Rui Camacho at
Oxford University. The main purpose was to understand ideas of inverse entailment which
eventually appeared in Stephen Muggleton's 1995 paper:
<EM>Inverse Entailment and Progol</EM>, New Gen. Comput., 13:245-286,
available at
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.york.ac.uk/pub/ML_GROUP/Papers/InvEnt.ps.gz">ftp://ftp.cs.york.ac.uk/pub/ML_GROUP/Papers/InvEnt.ps.gz</A>.
Since then, the implementation has evolved to emulate some of the
functionality of several other ILP systems. Some of these
of relevance to Aleph are: CProgol, FOIL, FORS, Indlog, MIDOS, SRT, Tilde, and WARMR.
See section <A HREF="#SEC37">Related versions and programs</A> for more details on obtaining
some of these programs.

Aleph is written in Prolog principally for use with the Yap Prolog
compiler. It should also run, albeit less efficiently, with SWI Prolog.
It is maintained by Ashwin Srinivasan at the University of Oxford,
and can be found at:

<H2><A ID="SEC4">The basic Aleph algorithm</A></H2>
<P>
<A ID="IDX3"></A>


<P>
During routine use, Aleph follows a very simple
procedure that can be described in 4 steps:



<OL>

<LI>

<STRONG>Select example.</STRONG> Select an example to be generalised. If none exist, stop,
otherwise proceed to the next step.

<LI>

<A ID="IDX4"></A>
<STRONG>Build most-specific-clause.</STRONG> Construct the most specific clause that
entails the example selected, and is within language restrictions provided.
This is usually a definite clause with many literals, and is called the "bottom
clause." This step is sometimes called the "saturation" step.
Details of constructing the bottom clause can be found in
Stephen Muggleton's 1995 paper: <EM>Inverse Entailment and Progol</EM>,
New Gen. Comput., 13:245-286, available at
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.york.ac.uk/pub/ML_GROUP/Papers/InvEnt.ps.gz">ftp://ftp.cs.york.ac.uk/pub/ML_GROUP/Papers/InvEnt.ps.gz</A>.

<LI>

<A ID="IDX5"></A>
<STRONG>Search.</STRONG> Find a clause more general than the bottom clause. This is
done by searching for some subset of the literals in the bottom clause
that has the "best" score. Two points should be noted. First, confining the search
to subsets of the bottom clause does not produce all the clauses more
general than it, but is good enough for this thumbnail sketch. Second, the
exact nature of the score of a clause is not really important here.
This step is sometimes called the "reduction" step.

<LI>

<STRONG>Remove redundant.</STRONG>  The clause with the best score is added to
the current theory, and all examples made redundant are removed.
This step is sometimes called the "cover removal" step.
Note here that the best clause may make clauses other than the examples
redundant. Again, this is ignored here.
Return to Step 1.

</OL>

<P>
A more advanced use of Aleph (see section <A HREF="#SEC18">Advanced use of Aleph</A>) allows
alteration to each of these steps. At the core of Aleph is
the "reduction" step, presented above as a simple "subset-selection" algorithm.
In fact, within Aleph, this is implemented
by a (restricted) branch-and-bound algorithm which allows an intelligent enumeration
of acceptable clauses under a range of different conditions. More on this can be found in
section <A HREF="#SEC45">On how the single-clause search is implemented</A>.

<P>
<A ID="IDX6"></A>




<H2><A ID="SEC6">Loading Aleph</A></H2>
<P>
<A ID="IDX7"></A>


<P>
Aleph code is contained in a single file, usually called
<TT>`alephX.pl'</TT> (the X stands for the current version number, for
example aleph4.pl refers to Version 4). To load
Aleph, you will need to consult this file into your Prolog
compiler, with sufficient stack and heap size (the more, the better!).
Here is an example of loading Aleph into the Yap compiler,
with a stack size of 5000 K bytes and heap size of 20000 K bytes:



<PRE>
yap -s5000 -h20000

[ Restoring file startup ]
 
yes

   ?- [aleph4]. 

</PRE>

<P>
Aleph requires 3 files to construct theories.  The
most straightforward use of Aleph would involve:



<OL>

<LI>

Construct the 3 data files called <TT>`filestem.b, filestem.f, filestem.n'</TT>.
See section <A HREF="#SEC7">Background knowledge file</A>, section <A HREF="#SEC11">Positive examples file</A>, and
section <A HREF="#SEC12">Negative examples file</A>.

<LI>

Read all data using the <CODE>read_all(filestem)</CODE> command.
See section <A HREF="#SEC13">Read all input files</A>.

<LI>

Construct a theory using the <CODE>induce</CODE> command
See section <A HREF="#SEC14">Construct a theory</A>.

</OL>



<H2><A ID="SEC7">Background knowledge file</A></H2>
<P>
<A ID="IDX8"></A>


<P>
All background knowledge for Aleph is contained in a file with
a <STRONG>.b</STRONG> extension. Background knowledge is in the form of Prolog
clauses that encode information relevant to the domain. It can also
contain any directives understood by the Prolog compiler being used
(for example, <CODE>:- consult(someotherfile).</CODE>). This file also contains
language and search restrictions for Aleph. The most
basic amongst these refer to <EM>modes, types</EM> and <EM>determinations</EM>
(see section <A HREF="#SEC8">Mode declarations</A>, section <A HREF="#SEC9">Type specifications</A>, and section <A HREF="#SEC10">Determinations</A>).




<H3><A ID="SEC8">Mode declarations</A></H3>
<P>
<A ID="IDX9"></A>


<P>
<A ID="IDX10"></A>
These declare the mode of call for predicates that can appear in any
clause hypothesised by Aleph. They take the form:



<PRE>

mode(RecallNumber,PredicateMode).

</PRE>

<P>
where <CODE>RecallNumber</CODE> bounds the non-determinacy of a form of predicate call,
and <CODE>PredicateMode</CODE> specifies a legal form for calling a predicate.


<P>
<CODE>RecallNumber</CODE> can be either (a) a number specifying the number of
successful calls to the predicate;
or (b) <STRONG>*</STRONG> specifying that the predicate has bounded non-determinacy.
It is usually easiest to specify <CODE>RecallNumber</CODE> as <STRONG>*</STRONG>.


<P>
<CODE>PredicateMode</CODE> is a template of the form:



<PRE>

p(ModeType, ModeType,...)

</PRE>

<P>
Here are some examples of how they appear in a file:



<PRE>
:- mode(1,mem(+number,+list)).
:- mode(1,dec(+integer,-integer)).
:- mode(1,mult(+integer,+integer,-integer)).
:- mode(1,plus(+integer,+integer,-integer)).
:- mode(1,(+integer)=(#integer)).
:- mode(*,has_car(+train,-car)).

</PRE>

<P>
Each ModeType is either (a) <STRONG>simple</STRONG>; or (b) <STRONG>structured</STRONG>.
A <STRONG>simple</STRONG> ModeType is one of: (a) <STRONG>+T</STRONG> specifying that when a literal
with predicate symbol <STRONG>p</STRONG> appears in a hypothesised clause, the corresponding
argument should be an "input" variable of type <STRONG>T</STRONG>; (b) <STRONG>-T</STRONG> specifying
that the argument is an "output" variable of type <STRONG>T</STRONG>; or
(c) <STRONG>#T</STRONG> specifying that it should be a constant of type <STRONG>T</STRONG>.
All the examples above have simple modetypes.
A <STRONG>structured</STRONG> ModeType is of the form <STRONG>f(..)</STRONG> where <STRONG>f</STRONG>
is a function symbol, each argument of which is either a simple or structured
ModeType. Here is an example containing a structured ModeType:



<PRE>
:- mode(1,mem(+number,[+number|+list])).

</PRE>

<P>
With these directives Aleph ensures that for any hypothesised
clause of the form <CODE>H:- B1, B2, ..., Bc</CODE>:



<OL>

<LI>

<STRONG>Input variables.</STRONG> Any input variable of type <STRONG>T</STRONG> in a body literal Bi
appears as an output variable of type <STRONG>T</STRONG> in a body
literal that appears before Bi, or appears as an input variable of type <STRONG>T</STRONG>
in H.

<LI>

<STRONG>Output variables.</STRONG>
Any output variable of type <STRONG>T</STRONG> in H appears as an output variable of
type <STRONG>T</STRONG> in Bi.

<LI>

<STRONG>Constants.</STRONG> 
Any arguments denoted by <STRONG>#T</STRONG> in the modes have only ground terms of
type <STRONG>T</STRONG>.

</OL>



<H3><A ID="SEC9">Type specifications</A></H3>
<P>
<A ID="IDX11"></A>


<P>
Types have to be specified for every argument of all predicates
to be used in constructing a hypothesis. This specification is
done within a <CODE>mode(...,...)</CODE> statement (see section <A HREF="#SEC8">Mode declarations</A>).
For Aleph types are just names, and no type-checking
is done. Variables of different types are treated distinctly, even if
one is a sub-type of the other.




<H3><A ID="SEC10">Determinations</A></H3>
<P>
<A ID="IDX12"></A>


<P>
<A ID="IDX13"></A>
Determination statements declare the predicated that can be used to construct
a hypothesis.  They take the form:
 

<PRE>
 
determination(TargetName/Arity,BackgroundName/Arity).
 
</PRE>

<P>
 
The first argument is the name and arity of the target predicate, that is,
the predicate that will appear in the head of hypothesised clauses.
The second argument is the name and arity of a predicate that can appear
in the body of such clauses. Typically there will be many determination
declarations for a target predicate, corresponding to the predicates
thought to be relevant in constructing hypotheses.
If no determinations are present Aleph does not construct any clauses.
Determinations are only allowed for 1 target predicate on any given
run of Aleph: if multiple target determinations occur,
the first one is chosen.


<P>
Here are some examples of how they appear in a file:



<PRE>
:- determination(eastbound/1,has_car/2).
:- determination(mult/3,mult/3).
:- determination(p/1,'='/2).
</PRE>



<H2><A ID="SEC11">Positive examples file</A></H2>
<P>
<A ID="IDX14"></A>


<P>
Positive examples of a concept to be learned with Aleph are
written in a file with a <STRONG>.f</STRONG> extension. The filestem should be
the same as that used for the background knowledge. The positive examples
are simply ground facts. Here are some examples of how they appear in a file:



<PRE>
eastbound(east1).
eastbound(east2).
eastbound(east3).
</PRE>

<P>
Code exists for dealing with non-ground positive examples.
However, this has never been tested rigorously.




<H2><A ID="SEC12">Negative examples file</A></H2>
<P>
<A ID="IDX15"></A>


<P>
Negative examples of a concept to be learned with Aleph are
written in a file with a <STRONG>.n</STRONG> extension. The filestem should be
the same as that used for the background knowledge. The negative examples
are simply ground facts. Here are some examples of how they appear in a file:



<PRE>
eastbound(west1).
eastbound(west1).
eastbound(west1).
</PRE>

<P>
Non-ground constraints can be a more compact way of expressing negative information.
Such constraints can be specified in the background knowledge file
(see section <A HREF="#SEC25">User-defined constraints</A>). Aleph is capable of learning from
positive examples only. This is done using a Bayesian evaluation function
(see <CODE>posonly</CODE> in section <A HREF="#SEC22">Evaluation functions</A>).




<H2><A ID="SEC13">Read all input files</A></H2>
<P>
<A ID="IDX16"></A>


<P>
<A ID="IDX17"></A>
Once  the <TT>`filestem.b, filestem.f'</TT> and <TT>`filestem.n'</TT> files are in
place, they can be read into Aleph with the command:



<PRE>

read_all(filestem).

</PRE>

<P>
Finer-grain specification of the example files can be achieved by setting
the <CODE>train_pos</CODE> and <CODE>train_neg</CODE> flags (see section <A HREF="#SEC19">Setting Aleph parameters</A>).




<H2><A ID="SEC14">Construct a theory</A></H2>
<P>
<A ID="IDX18"></A>


<P>
<A ID="IDX19"></A>
The basic command for selecting examples and constructing
a theory is:



<PRE>
              induce.
</PRE>

<P>
When issued Aleph does the four steps described earlier
(see section <A HREF="#SEC4">The basic Aleph algorithm</A>). The result
is usually a trace that lists clauses searched along with their
positive and negative example coverage, like:



<PRE>

eastbound(A) :-
   has_car(A,B).
[5/5]
eastbound(A) :-
   has_car(A,B), short(B).
[5/5]
eastbound(A) :-
   has_car(A,B), open_car(B).
[5/5]
eastbound(A) :-
   has_car(A,B), shape(B,rectangle).
[5/5]

</PRE>

<P>
and the final result that looks like:



<PRE>

[theory]
 
[Rule 1] [Pos cover = 5 Neg cover = 0]

eastbound(A) :-
       has_car(A,B), short(B), closed(B).

[pos-neg] [5]

</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>induce</CODE> also reports the performance on the training data as a confusion
matrix that looks like:



<PRE>

[Training set performance]

           Actual
        +          -  
     +  5          0         5 
Pred 
     -  0          5         5
 
        5          5         10
 
Accuracy = 100%

</PRE>

<P>
Performance on a test data is also reported if values for the parameters <CODE>test_pos</CODE>

<LI>

<STRONG>Select example.</STRONG> A sample of more than 1 example can be selected
(see <CODE>samplesize</CODE> in section <A HREF="#SEC19">Setting Aleph parameters</A>).
The best clause obtained from reducing each corresponding
bottom clause is then added to the theory. Alternatively, no sampling need
be performed, and every example can be saturated and reduced
(see <CODE>induce</CODE> in section <A HREF="#SEC20">Altering the search</A>).

<LI>

<STRONG>Build most-specific-clause.</STRONG> Bottom clauses may be constructed
"lazily" or not at all (see <CODE>construct_bottom</CODE> in section <A HREF="#SEC19">Setting Aleph parameters</A>).
Literals in the a bottom clause may be evaluated "lazily"
(see <CODE>lazy_evaluate</CODE> in section <A HREF="#SEC36">Other commands</A>). Individual bottom
clauses can be constructed and examined (see <CODE>sat</CODE> in
section <A HREF="#SEC36">Other commands</A>).

<LI>

<STRONG>Search.</STRONG> The search for clauses can be altered and customised to
try different search strategies, evaluation functions, and refinement
operators (see section <A HREF="#SEC20">Altering the search</A>). A bottom clause can be reduced
repeatedly using different search constraints
(see <CODE>reduce</CODE> in section <A HREF="#SEC36">Other commands</A>).

<LI>

<STRONG>Remove redundant.</STRONG>  Examples covered may be retained to give
better estimates of clause scores
(see <CODE>induce</CODE> in section <A HREF="#SEC20">Altering the search</A>).

</OL>

<P>
There is now some software in place that allows
exploration of the following:



<OL>

<LI>

<STRONG>Randomised search.</STRONG> The basic Aleph algorithm 
does a fairly standard general-to-specific search. Some variation
on this is possible by the user specifying his or her own refinement
operator. In other areas (satisfiability of propositional formulae,
simulation of discrete events), randomised methods have proven
extremely useful tools to search very large spaces. The implementation
within Aleph is an adaptation of the standard randomised
methods: GSAT, WSAT, RRR, and the Metropolis algorithm
(a special case of simulated annealing with a fixed `temperature')
(see section <A HREF="#SEC28">Randomised search methods</A> and section <A HREF="#SEC20">Altering the search</A>).

<LI>

<STRONG>Incremental learning.</STRONG> The basic Aleph algorithm is
a "batch" learner in the sense that all examples and background are
expected to be in place before learning commences. An incremental
mode allows Aleph to acquire new examples and background information
by interacting with the user (see section <A HREF="#SEC29">Incremental construction of theories</A>).

<LI>

<STRONG>Theory learning.</STRONG> The basic Aleph algorithm constructs
a "theory" one clause at a time. This is an implementation of the
greedy set-cover algorithm to the problem of identifying a set of
clauses. There is some empirical and theoretical work done on
on ILP of sets of clauses at once: see the work of I. Bratko
and H. Midelfart in <EM>Proceedings of the Ninth International
Workshop on Inductive Logic Programming (ILP'99)</EM>, LNAI-1634.
Theory learning by Aleph uses randomised search
methods (see next) to search through the space of theories. It has not been
tested to any significant extent (see section <A HREF="#SEC30">Theory-level search</A>).

<LI>

<STRONG>Learning trees.</STRONG> The basic Aleph algorithm constructs
clauses using a greedy set-covering algorithm. In some sense, this
can be seen as the first-order equivalent of propositional rule-learning
algorithms like Clark and Niblett's CN2. There is now a substantial body of
empirical work (done by researchers in Leuven and Freiburg) demonstrating
the utility of first-order equivalents of propositional tree-learning procedures.
Tree-based learning can be seen as a special case of theory learning
and the implementation in Aleph uses the standard recursive-partitioning
approach to construct classification, regression, class probability, or
model trees (see section <A HREF="#SEC31">Tree-based theories</A>).

<LI>

<STRONG>Learning constraints.</STRONG> The basic Aleph algorithm constructs
definite clauses normally intended to be components of a predictive model for
data. Early ILP work (in the Claudien system) demonstrated the value of discovering
all non-Horn constraints that hold in a database. The implementation
of these ideas in Aleph uses a naive generate-and-test strategy
to enumerate all constraints within the mode language provided
(see section <A HREF="#SEC32">Constraint learning</A>).

<LI>

<STRONG>Learning modes.</STRONG> The basic Aleph algorithm assumes
modes will be declared by the user. There has been some work (by McCreath
and Sharma) on automatic extraction of mode and type information from the
background knowledge provided. The implementation
of these ideas in Aleph follows these ideas fairly closely
(see section <A HREF="#SEC33">Mode learning</A>).

<LI>

<STRONG>Learning features.</STRONG> The basic Aleph algorithm constructs
a set of rules that, along with the background knowledge, entail the
positive examples. Good clauses found during the search for this set of
rules can be used to construct boolean features. These can then be used
techniques like maximum entropy modelling, support vector machines and so on
(see section <A HREF="#SEC35">Feature Construction</A>).

These are all at very early stages of development and therefore
even less reliable than the rest of the code (probably).

literals in a clause.

<DT><CODE>set(check_useless,+<VAR>V</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
<A ID="IDX38"></A>
<A ID="IDX39"></A>
<VAR>V</VAR> is one of: <CODE>true</CODE> or <CODE>false</CODE>
(default <CODE>false</CODE>). If set to <CODE>true</CODE>, removes literals in

<A ID="IDX52"></A>
<VAR>V</VAR> is one of: <CODE>saturation</CODE>, <CODE>reduction</CODE> or <CODE>false</CODE>
(default <CODE>saturation</CODE>). Specifies the stage at which the bottom
clause is constructed.  If <CODE>reduction</CODE> then it is constructed lazily
during the search. This is useful if the bottom clause is too large to be
constructed prior to search. This also sets the flag <CODE>lazy_bottom</CODE>
to <CODE>true</CODE>. The user has to provide a refinement operator
definition (using <CODE>refine/2</CODE>). If not, the <CODE>refine</CODE> parameter
is set to <CODE>auto</CODE>.  If <CODE>false</CODE> then no bottom clause is
constructed. The user would normally provide a refinement operator
definition in this case.

If <CODE>true</CODE> then forces search to continue until the point
that all remaining elements in the search space are
definitely worse than the current best element (normally, search would stop

positive examples below this number, then it is  not added to the current theory.
This can be used to prevent Aleph from adding ground unit clauses to the theory

<DT><CODE>set(proof_strategy,+<VAR>V</VAR>)</CODE>

<A ID="IDX120"></A>
<A ID="IDX121"></A>
<VAR>V</VAR> is one of: <CODE>restricted_sld</CODE>, <CODE>sld</CODE>, or <CODE>user</CODE> (default
<CODE>restricted_sld</CODE>). If <CODE>restricted_sld</CODE>, then examples covered
are determined by forcing current hypothesised clause to
be the first parent clause in a SLD resolution proof. If <CODE>sld</CODE> then this
restriction is not enforced. The former strategy is efficient, but not
refutation complete. It is sufficient if all that is needed is to determine
how many examples are covered by the current clause, which is what is
needed when Aleph is used to construct a set of non-recursive clauses
greedily (for example using the <CODE>induce/0</CODE> command: see section <A HREF="#SEC14">Construct a theory</A>). If set to <CODE>user</CODE> then Aleph expects a user-defined
predicate <CODE>prove/2</CODE>, the first argument of which is a clause <CODE>C</CODE>,
and the second is an example <CODE>E</CODE>. <CODE>prove(C,E)</CODE> succeeds if
example <CODE>E</CODE> is provable using clause <CODE>C</CODE> and the background

<DT><CODE>set(refine,+<VAR>V</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
<A ID="IDX129"></A>
<A ID="IDX130"></A>
<VAR>V</VAR> is one of: <CODE>user</CODE>, <CODE>auto</CODE>, 
or <CODE>false</CODE> (default <CODE>false</CODE>). Specifies the nature of
the customised refinement operator. In all cases, the resulting clauses are
required to subsume the bottom clause, if one exists. If <CODE>false</CODE> then no
customisation is assumed and standard operation results.
If <CODE>user</CODE> then the user specifies a domain-specific refinement
operator with <CODE>refine/2</CODE> statements. If <CODE>auto</CODE> then an automatic
enumeration of all clauses in the mode language (see section <A HREF="#SEC8">Mode declarations</A>) is performed.
The result is a breadth-first branch-and-bound search starting from the
empty clause.
This is useful if a bottom clause is either not constructed or is
constructed lazily. No attempt is made to ensure any kind of optimality
and the same clauses may result from several different refinement paths.
Some rudimentary checking can be achieved by setting <CODE>caching</CODE>
to <CODE>true</CODE>. The user has to ensure the following for
<CODE>refine</CODE> is set to <CODE>auto</CODE>: (1) the setting to <CODE>auto</CODE> is
done after the modes and determinations commands, as these are used to
generate internally a set of clauses that allow enumeration of clauses
in the language; (2) all arguments that are
annotated as <STRONG>#T</STRONG> in the modes  contain
generative definitions for type <STRONG>T</STRONG>. These are called be the
clauses generated internally to obtain the appropriate constants; and
(3) the head mode is clearly specified using the <CODE>modeh</CODE> construct.

<VAR>V</VAR> is an integer (default 10000). Sets the counter for variables

variable that has a unique number which is no smaller than <VAR>V</VAR>. This
number has to be larger than the number of variables that would otherwise appear
in a bottom clause.

<DT><CODE>set(splitvars,+<VAR>V</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
<A ID="IDX149"></A>
<VAR>V</VAR> is one of: <CODE>true</CODE> or <CODE>false</CODE> (default <CODE>false</CODE>). If
set to <CODE>true</CODE> before constructing a bottom clause, then variable
co-references in the bottom clause are split apart by new variables.
The new variables can occur at input or output positions of the head literal,
and only at output positions in body literals. Equality literals
between new and old variables are inserted into the bottom clause to maintain
equivalence. It may also result in variable renamed versions of other literals being
inserted into the bottom clause. All of this increases the search space considerably
and can make the search explore redundant clauses. The current version also
elects to perform variable splitting whilst constructing the bottom clause
(in contrast to doing it dynamically whilst searching). This was to avoid
unnecessary checks  that could slow down the search when variable splitting was
not required. This means the bottom clause can be extremely large, and the
whole process is probably not very practical for large numbers of co-references.
The procedure has not been rigourously tested to quantify this.

when drawing clauses randomly from the clause-space. If set
set to <CODE>true</CODE> then clauses are drawn by uniform random selection from
the space of legal clauses. Since there are usually many more longer

<P>
<A ID="IDX183"></A>


<P>
Aleph allows the basic procedure for theory construction to be
altered in a number of ways. Besides the <CODE>induce</CODE>
command, there are several other commands that can be used
to construct a theory. The <CODE>induce</CODE> family of commands are:



<OL>

<LI><CODE>induce/0</CODE>. This has already been described in

detail previously (see section <A HREF="#SEC14">Construct a theory</A>);

<LI><CODE>induce_cover/0</CODE>.

<A ID="IDX184"></A>
This command 
is very similar to <CODE>induce</CODE>.
The only difference is that positive examples covered by a clause are
not removed prior to seeding on a new (uncovered) example. After a
search with <CODE>induce_cover</CODE> Aleph only removes the
the examples covered by the best clause are removed from a pool of
seed examples only. After this, a new example or set of examples
is chosen from the seeds left, and the process repeats.
The theories returned by <CODE>induce</CODE> and <CODE>induce_cover</CODE> are dependent
on the order in which positive examples are presented;

<LI><CODE>induce_max/0</CODE>.

<A ID="IDX185"></A>
The theory returned by this command is unaffected by the ordering
of positive examples.  This is because it saturates and reduces every
example. The search is made more efficient by
remembering the coverage of the best clause obtained so far for
each example being generalised. Both <CODE>induce_cover</CODE> and <CODE>induce_max</CODE>
are slower than <CODE>induce</CODE>, and usually produce clauses with a great
deal of overlap in coverage. A separate program will have to be
used to find some subset of these clauses that minimises this
overlap (see <EM>T-Reduce</EM> in section <A HREF="#SEC37">Related versions and programs</A>).

<LI><CODE>induce_incremental/0</CODE>.

<A ID="IDX186"></A>
This command constructs a theory in an incremental mode: the
user is allowed to update the examples and background knowledge.
This mode of learning is described further in section <A HREF="#SEC29">Incremental construction of theories</A>.

<LI><CODE>induce_clauses/0</CODE>.

<A ID="IDX187"></A>
This command is simply <CODE>induce/0</CODE> or <CODE>induce_incremental/0</CODE>
depending on whether the flag <CODE>interactive</CODE> is <CODE>false</CODE> or
<CODE>true</CODE>.

<LI><CODE>induce_theory/0</CODE>.

<A ID="IDX188"></A>
This command abandons the clause-by-clause approach to theory
construction. Instead, search is done at the theory-level. This
is untested and the current implementation should not be considered
definitive. See section <A HREF="#SEC30">Theory-level search</A> for more details.

<LI><CODE>induce_tree/0</CODE>.

<A ID="IDX189"></A>
This command abandons the clause-by-clause approach to theory
construction. Instead, search is done by constructing a 
tree using the standard recursive-partitioning approach.
See section <A HREF="#SEC31">Tree-based theories</A> for more details.

<LI><CODE>induce_constraints/0</CODE>.

<A ID="IDX190"></A>
This command abandons the search for predictive clauses.
Instead, search results in all constraints that hold within the
background knowledge provided.
See section <A HREF="#SEC32">Constraint learning</A> for more details.

<LI><CODE>induce_modes/0</CODE>.

<A ID="IDX191"></A>
This command searches for a mode and type assignment that
is consistent with the background knowledge provided.
See section <A HREF="#SEC33">Mode learning</A> for more details.

<LI><CODE>induce_features/0</CODE>.

<A ID="IDX192"></A>
This command searches for boolean features given the
examples and the background knowledge.
See section <A HREF="#SEC35">Feature Construction</A> for more details.

</OL>

<P>
The search for individual clauses (when performed) is principally
affected by two parameters. One
sets the search strategy (<CODE>search</CODE>) and the other sets the
evaluation function (<CODE>evalfn</CODE>).




<H3><A ID="SEC21">Search strategies</A></H3>
<P>
<A ID="IDX193"></A>


<P>
A search strategy is set using <CODE>set(search,Strategy)</CODE>.
The following search strategies apply to the
clause-by-clause searches conducted by Aleph:


<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>ar</CODE>
<DD>
<A ID="IDX194"></A>
<A ID="IDX195"></A>
Implements a simplified form of the type of association rule
search conducted by the WARMR system (see L. Dehaspe, 1998, PhD Thesis,
Katholieke Universitaet Leuven).
Here, Aleph simply finds all rules that cover at least a pre-specified
fraction of the positive examples. This fraction is specified
by the parameter <CODE>pos_fraction</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>bf</CODE>
<DD>
<A ID="IDX196"></A>
<A ID="IDX197"></A>
Enumerates shorter clauses before longer ones. At a given clauselength,
clauses are re-ordered based on their evaluation. This is the default
search strategy;

<DT><CODE>df</CODE>
<DD>
<A ID="IDX198"></A>
<A ID="IDX199"></A>
Enumerates longer clauses before shorter ones. At a given clauselength,
clauses are re-ordered based on their evaluation.

<DT><CODE>heuristic</CODE>
<DD>
<A ID="IDX200"></A>
<A ID="IDX201"></A>
Enumerates clauses in a best-first manner.

<DT><CODE>ibs</CODE>

<A ID="IDX202"></A>
<A ID="IDX203"></A>
Performs an iterative beam search as described by Quinlan and Cameron-Jones, IJCAI-95.
Limit set by value for <CODE>nodes</CODE> applies to any 1 iteration.

<DT><CODE>ic</CODE>
<DD>
<A ID="IDX204"></A>
<A ID="IDX205"></A>
Performs search for integrity constraints. Used by <CODE>induce_constraints</CODE>
(see section <A HREF="#SEC32">Constraint learning</A>)

<DT><CODE>id</CODE>
<DD>
<A ID="IDX206"></A>
<A ID="IDX207"></A>
Performs an iterative deepening search up to the maximum clause length specified.

<DT><CODE>ils</CODE>
<DD>
<A ID="IDX208"></A>
<A ID="IDX209"></A>
An iterative <CODE>bf</CODE> search strategy that, starting from 1,  progressively increases the
upper-bound on the number of occurrences of a predicate symbol in any
clause. Limit set by value for <CODE>nodes</CODE> applies to any 1 iteration.
This language-based search was developed by Rui Camacho and is described in
his PhD thesis.

<DT><CODE>rls</CODE>
<DD>
<A ID="IDX210"></A>
<A ID="IDX211"></A>
Use of the GSAT, WSAT, RRR and simulated annealing
algorithms for search in ILP. The choice of these is specified by the parameter
<CODE>rls_type</CODE> (see section <A HREF="#SEC19">Setting Aleph parameters</A>). GSAT, RRR, and annealing
all employ random multiple restarts, each of which serves as the
starting point for local moves in the search space. A limit
on the number of restarts is specified by the parameter
<CODE>tries</CODE> and that on the number of moves by <CODE>moves</CODE>.
Annealing is currently restricted to a using a fixed temperature,
making it equivalent to an algorithm due to Metropolis. The temperature
is specified by setting the parameter <CODE>temperature</CODE>. The implementation
of WSAT requires a "random-walk probability", which is specified by the
parameter <CODE>walk</CODE>. A walk probability of 0 is equivalent to GSAT.
More details on randomised search can be found in
section <A HREF="#SEC28">Randomised search methods</A>.

<DT><CODE>scs</CODE>
<DD>
<A ID="IDX212"></A>
<A ID="IDX213"></A>
A special case of GSAT that results from repeated random selection of
clauses from the hypothesis space. The number of clauses is either
set by <CODE>scs_sample</CODE> or is calculated from the settings for
<CODE>scs_prob</CODE> and <CODE>scs_percentile</CODE>. These represent: the
minimum probability of selecting a "good" clause; and the meaning
of a "good" clause, namely, that it is in the top K-percentile of clauses.
This invokes GSAT search with <CODE>tries</CODE> set to the sample size
and <CODE>moves</CODE> set to 0. Clause selection can either be blind or
informed by some preliminary Monte-Carlo style estimation. This is
controlled by <CODE>scs_type</CODE>. More details can be found in

<H3><A ID="SEC23">Built-in and user-defined pruning</A></H3>
<P>
<A ID="IDX230"></A>


<P>
Two sorts of pruning can be distinguished within Aleph when
performing a clause-level search.
Internal pruning refers to built-in pruning that performs admissible
removal of clauses from a search. This is currently available
for the following evaluation functions: auto_m, compression, coverage,
laplace, mestimate, posonly, and wracc. User-defined prune statements can be written
to specify the conditions under which a user
knows for certain that a clause (or its refinements)
could not possibly be an acceptable hypothesis.
Such clauses are pruned from the search.
The "prune" definition is written in the background knowledge
file (that has extension <TT>`.b'</TT>).  The definition is distinguished
by the fact that they are all rules of the form:


<P>
<A ID="IDX231"></A>

<PRE>

prune((ClauseHead:-ClauseBody)) :-
        Body.

</PRE>

<P>
The following example is from a pharmaceutical
application that states that every extension of a clause
representing a "pharmacophore" with six "pieces" is unacceptable,
and that the search should be pruned at such a clause.
 

<PRE>
prune((Head:-Body)) :-
        violates_constraints(Body).
 
violates_constraints(Body) :-
        has_pieces(Body,Pieces),
        violates_constraints(Body,Pieces).
 
violates_constraints(Body,[_,_,_,_,_,_]).

has_pieces(...) :- 
</PRE>

<P>
The use of such pruning can greatly improve Aleph's
efficiency. They can be seen as a special case of providing distributional
information about the hypothesis space.




<H3><A ID="SEC24">User-defined cost specification</A></H3>
<P>
<A ID="IDX232"></A>


<P>
The use of a user-specified cost function is a fundamental
construct in statistical decision theory, and provides a general method
of scoring descriptions. Aleph 
allows the specification of the cost of a clause.
The cost statements are written in the background knowledge
file (that has extension <TT>`.b'</TT>), and are distinguished
by the fact that they are all rules of the form:
 
<A ID="IDX233"></A>

<PRE>
cost(Clause,ClauseLabel,Cost):-
        Body.
</PRE>

<P>
where <CODE>ClauseLabel</CODE> is the list <CODE>[P,N,L]</CODE>
where <CODE>P</CODE> is the number of positive examples covered by the
clause, <CODE>N</CODE> is the number of negative examples covered by the clause
<CODE>L</CODE> is the number of literals in the clause.


<P>
It is usually not possible to devise automatically admissible pruning
strategies for an arbitrary cost function. Thus, when using a user-defined
cost measure, Aleph places the burden of specifying a pruning
strategy on the user.




<H3><A ID="SEC25">User-defined constraints</A></H3>
<P>
<A ID="IDX234"></A>


<P>
Aleph accepts integrity constraints that should not
be violated by a hypothesis.
These are written in the background knowledge file (that has extension
<TT>`.b'</TT>) and are similar to the integrity constraints in the ILP
programs Clint and Claudien. The constraints are distinguished
by the fact that they are all rules of the form:
 
<A ID="IDX235"></A>

<PRE>
false:-
         Body.
</PRE>

<P>
 
where <CODE>Body</CODE> is a set of literals that specify the condition(s) that should
not be violated by a clause found by Aleph.
It is usual to use the
<CODE>hypothesis/3</CODE> (see section <A HREF="#SEC36">Other commands</A>) command
to obtain the clause currently being considered by Aleph.
 
The following example is from a pharmaceutical
application that states that hypotheses
are unacceptable if they have fewer than three "pieces" or
which do not specify the distances between all pairs of pieces.


<P>
<A ID="IDX236"></A>

<PRE>
false:-
        hypothesis(Head,Body,_),
        has_pieces(Body,Pieces),
        length(Pieces,N),
        N =&#60; 2.
false:-
        hypothesis(_,Body,_),
        has_pieces(Body,Pieces),
        incomplete_distances(Body,Pieces).

</PRE>

<P>
The use of constraints is another way for
Aleph
to obtain interesting hypothesis without negative examples. Ordinarily,
this will result in a single clause that classifies every
example as positive. Such clauses can be precluded by constraints.
Note also that an integrity constraint does not state that a
refinement of a clause that violates one or more constraints
will also be unacceptable.
When constructing clauses in an incremental mode, Aleph can be
instructed to add a special type of constraint
to prevent the construction of overly general clauses
(see section <A HREF="#SEC29">Incremental construction of theories</A>).




<H3><A ID="SEC26">User-defined refinement</A></H3>
<P>
<A ID="IDX237"></A>
Aleph allows a method of specifying the refinement operator to
be used in a clause-level search. This is done 
using a Prolog definition for the predicate
<CODE>refine/2</CODE>.
The definition specifies the transitions in the
refinement graph traversed in a
search.
The "refine" definition is written in the background knowledge
file (that has extension ".b").  The definition is distinguished
by the fact that they are all rules of the form:


<P>
<A ID="IDX238"></A>



<PRE>
refine(Clause1,Clause2):-
           Body.
</PRE>

<P>
This specifies that Clause1 is refined to Clause2. The definition
can be nondeterministic, and the set of refinements for any one
clause are obtained by repeated backtracking. For any refinement
Aleph
ensures that Clause2 implies the current most specific clause. Clause2
can contain cuts ("!") in its body.


<P>
The following example is from a pharmaceutical
application that states that searches for a "pharmacophore"
that consists of 4 "pieces" (each piece is some functional group),
and associated distances in 3-D space. Auxilliary definitions
for predicates like member/2 and dist/5 are not shown.
representing a "pharmacophore" with six "pieces" is unacceptable,
and that the search should be pruned at such a clause.



<PRE>
refine(false,active(A)).

refine(active(A),Clause):-
        member(Pred1,[hacc(A,B),hdonor(A,B),zincsite(A,B)]),
        member(Pred2,[hacc(A,C),hdonor(A,C),zincsite(A,C)]),
        member(Pred3,[hacc(A,D),hdonor(A,D),zincsite(A,D)]),
        member(Pred4,[hacc(A,E),hdonor(A,E),zincsite(A,E)]),
        Clause = (active(A):-
                        Pred1,
                        Pred2,
                        dist(A,B,C,D1,E1),
                        Pred3,
                        dist(A,B,D,D2,E2),
                        dist(A,C,D,D3,E3),
                        Pred4,
                        dist(A,B,E,D4,E4),
                        dist(A,C,E,D5,E5),
                        dist(A,D,E,D6,E6)).

</PRE>

<P>
To invoke the use of such statements requires
setting <CODE>refine</CODE> to <CODE>user</CODE>.
For other settings of <CODE>refine</CODE> see entry for <CODE>refine</CODE>
in section <A HREF="#SEC19">Setting Aleph parameters</A>.




<H3><A ID="SEC27">Specific-to-general search</A></H3>
<P>
<A ID="IDX239"></A>


<P>
Up to early variants of Version 5 has never, in any
satisfactory manner, been able to perform a
specific-to-general search (in the sense, say, of Golem or CIGOL): the
only way to do this was to use a user-defined refinement operator in the
manner just described, that progressively generalises a clause. For
example:



<PRE>
refine(false,Clause):-
        !,
        bottom(Clause).

refine(Clause1,Clause2):-
        generalise(Clause1,Clause2).

</PRE>

<P>
(The definition for <CODE>bottom/1</CODE> is available within Aleph. The definition
for <CODE>generalise/2</CODE> has to be written separately.)


<P>
From Version 5 (time stamp Sun Mar 11 03:25:37 UTC 2007), a slightly more
interesting approach is possible by setting the values of specific
parameters. For example, with the following parameter settings:



<PRE>
       :- set(samplesize,4).
       :- set(resample,4).
       :- set(permute_bottom,true).
       :- set(nreduce_bottom,true).
       :- set(search,false).

</PRE>

<P>
a call to <CODE>induce/0</CODE> will perform a specific-to-general search in the
following manner: four examples are chosen at random (<CODE>samplesize</CODE> is
set to <CODE>4</CODE>). Each example is resampled four times (<CODE>resample</CODE> is
set to <CODE>4</CODE>), resulting in a sequence of 16 trials in which each of
the four examples appear four times in the sequence. For each entry in the
sequence, the following steps are performed: (1) The bottom clause is
constructed with body literals shuffled (<CODE>permute_bottom</CODE> is set to
<CODE>true</CODE>); (2) The bottom clause is generalised by using the negative
examples (<CODE>nreduce_bottom</CODE> is set to <CODE>true</CODE>); (3) No further
search is performed (<CODE>search</CODE> is set to <CODE>false</CODE>) and the
resulting clause is evaluated.  The best clause is added to the
theory, the examples covered removed, and the entire process repeated.
The procedure is akin to, but not the same as that used by Golem. 
A combination of a specific-to-general and other search strategies
can be used if <CODE>search</CODE> is not set to <CODE>false</CODE>. In this case,
a search of lattice of clauses subsuming the negative-reduced bottom
will be performed using the setting for <CODE>search</CODE>.




<H2><A ID="SEC28">Randomised search methods</A></H2>
<P>
<A ID="IDX240"></A>


<P>
The simplest kind of randomised search is the following: sample
N elements (clauses or theories) from the search space. Score these
and return the best element. Ordinal optimisation is a technique
that investigates the loss in optimality resulting from this form
of search. See:


<P>
<A HREF="http://hrl.harvard.edu/people/faculty/ho/DEDS/OO/OOTOC.html">http://hrl.harvard.edu/people/faculty/ho/DEDS/OO/OOTOC.html</A> 


<P>
A study of the use of this in ILP can be found in:
A. Srinivasan, <EM>A study of two probabilistic methods for searching
large spaces with ILP</EM> (under review), available at:


<P>
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.comlab.ox.ac.uk/pub/Packages/ILP/Papers/AS/dami99.ps.gz">ftp://ftp.comlab.ox.ac.uk/pub/Packages/ILP/Papers/AS/dami99.ps.gz</A>


<P>
For a clause-level search, this
is invoked by setting the parameter <CODE>search</CODE> to <CODE>scs</CODE> (to
denote "stochastic clause selection"). The number N is either
set by assigning a value to <CODE>scs_sample</CODE> or calculated automatically
from settings for <CODE>scs_prob</CODE> and <CODE>scs_percentile</CODE>. If these values
are denoted "P" and "K" respectively, then the sample size is calculated
to be <CODE>log(1-P)/log(1-K/100)</CODE>, which denotes the number of clauses
that have to be sampled before obtaining, with probability at least P, at least
one clause in the top K-percentile of clauses
Sampling is further controlled by
by specifying the setting <CODE>scs_type</CODE> to be one of <CODE>blind</CODE> or <CODE>informed</CODE>. 
If "blind" then clauses are uniform random selections from the space of all
legal clauses. If "informed" then they are drawn from a specific distribution
over clauselengths. This can either be pre-specified (by setting
<CODE>clauselength_distribution</CODE>) or obtained automatically by a
Monte-Carlo like scheme that attempts to estimate, for each clause length,
the probablity of obtaining a clause in the top K-percentile. In either
case, the resulting distribution over clauselengths is used to first
decide on the number of literals "l" in the clause. A legal clause with
"l" literals is then constructed.


<P>
In fact, this simple randomised search is a degenerate form of a
more general algorithm known as GSAT. Originally proposed within the
context of determining satisfiability of propositional formulae, the
basic algorithm is as follows:



<PRE>
currentbest:= 0 (<STRONG>comment</STRONG>: ``0'' is a conventional default answer)
<STRONG>for</STRONG> i = 1 to N <STRONG>do</STRONG> 
   current:= randomly selected starting point 
   <STRONG>if</STRONG> current is better than currenbest <STRONG>then</STRONG>
        currentbest:= current
   <STRONG>for</STRONG> j = 1 to M <STRONG>do begin</STRONG>
        next:= best local move from current
        <STRONG>if</STRONG> next is better than currenbest <STRONG>then</STRONG>
            currentbest:= next
        current:= next
   <STRONG>end</STRONG>
<STRONG>return</STRONG> currentbest
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>N</CODE> and <CODE>M</CODE> represent the number of tries and moves
allowed. It is apparent that when searching for clauses,
a <CODE>M</CODE> value of 0 will result
in the algorithm mimicking stochastic clause selection as described above.
A variant of this algorithm called Walksat introduces a further random
element at the point of selecting <CODE>next</CODE>. This time, a biased coin
is flipped. If a "head" results then the choice is as per GSAT (that is,
the best choice amongst the local neighbours), otherwise <CODE>next</CODE>
is randomly assigned to one of any "potentially good" neighbours.
Potentially good neighbours are those that <EM>may</EM> lead to a better
score than the current best score. This is somewhat like
simulated annealing, where the choice is the best element if that
improves on the best score. Otherwise, the choice is made according
to a function that decays exponentially with the difference in
scores. This exponential decay is usually weighted by a "temperature"
parameter.


<P>
The randomly selected start clause is usually constructed as follows:
(1) an example is selected; (2) the bottom clause is constructed for
the example; (3) a legal clause is randomly drawn from this bottom
clause. The example may be selected by the user (using
the <CODE>sat</CODE> command). If bottom clauses are not allowed (by
setting <CODE>construct_bottom</CODE> to <CODE>false</CODE>) then legal clauses
are constructed directly from the mode declarations. The clause selected
is either the result of uniform random selection from all legal clauses,
or the result of a specific distribution over clauselengths
(specified by setting <CODE>clauselength_distribution</CODE>).
The latter is the only method permitted when bottom clauses are not allowed.
(In that case, if there is no value specified for <CODE>clauselength_distribution</CODE>,
then a uniform distribution over all allowable lengths 
is used.)


<P>
RRR refers to the `randomised rapid restarts' as described by 
F. Zelezny, A. Srinivasan, and D. Page in
<EM>Lattice Search Runtime Distributions May Be Heavy-Tailed</EM>
available at:


<P>
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.comlab.ox.ac.uk/pub/Packages/ILP/Papers/AS/rrr.ps.gz">ftp://ftp.comlab.ox.ac.uk/pub/Packages/ILP/Papers/AS/rrr.ps.gz</A>


<P>
In the current implementation,
RRR stops as soon as a clause with an requisite minimum positive coverage
(set using <CODE>minpos</CODE>) and acceptable utility is reached (set using <CODE>minscore</CODE>).
The procedure in the paper above stops as soon as a minimum acceptable
accuracy is reached. This same effect can be achieved by setting <CODE>evalfn</CODE>
to <CODE>accuracy</CODE>.


<P>
It is intended that the randomised local search methods
(GSAT, Walksat, RRR and  annealing) can be used either for clause-level
search or theory-level search. No equivalent of stochastic clause
selection is provided for theory-level search: this has to be
mimicked by using the randomised local search, with appropriate
settings.
At the clause
level, local moves involve either adding or deleting a literal
from the current clause. Normally, local moves in the clause-space
would also involve operations on variables (introducing or removing
variable co-references, associating or disassociating variables to
constants). These have to accomplished within Aleph by
the inclusion of an equality predicate with appropriate mode declarations.
Local moves for a theory-level search
are described in section <A HREF="#SEC30">Theory-level search</A>.


<P>
Randomised local search
is invoked within Aleph by setting the parameter <CODE>search</CODE> to <CODE>rls</CODE>. In
addition, the type of search is specified by setting <CODE>rls_type</CODE>
to one of <CODE>gsat</CODE>, <CODE>wsat</CODE>, <CODE>rrr</CODE> or <CODE>anneal</CODE>. Walksat requires
a specification of a biased coin.
This is done by setting the parameter <CODE>walk</CODE> to a number between
<CODE>0</CODE> and <CODE>1</CODE>. This represents  an upper bound on the
probability of obtaining a "tail" with the coin.
The implementation of simulated annealing
is very simple and uses a fixed temperature.
This is done by setting the parameter <CODE>temperature</CODE> to some real value.




<H2><A ID="SEC29">Incremental construction of theories</A></H2>
<P>
<A ID="IDX241"></A>


<P>
Most prominent ILP systems are "batch learners": all examples and
background knowledge are in place <EM>before</EM> learning commences.
The ILP system then constructs a hypothesis for the examples.
A less popular, but nevertheless interesting alternative is 
that of "incremental learning", where examples, background
and hypothesis are incrementally updated <EM>during</EM> the
course of learning. Aleph allows such
an incremental construction of clauses by typing:



<PRE>
              induce_incremental.
</PRE>

<P>
This results in Aleph repeatedly performing the following steps:



<OL>

<LI>

<STRONG>Ask user for an example.</STRONG> The default is to use a
new positive example from previous search. If the user
responds with Ctrl-d (eof) then search stops. If the
user responds with "ok." then default is used; otherwise
the user has to provide a new example (terminated by a full-stop);
 
<LI>

<STRONG>Construct bottom clause for example.</STRONG> Aleph thus expects
the appropriate mode declarations. These can be added in Step 4;

<LI>

<STRONG>Search.</STRONG> Aleph searches for the best clause;

<LI>

<STRONG>Ask user about best clause.</STRONG> Aleph asks the user about the
clause <EM>C</EM> returned by the search. At this point the user can
respond with:


<UL>
<LI><STRONG>ok.</STRONG> Clause <EM>C</EM> is added to the hypothesis;

<LI><STRONG>prune.</STRONG> Statement added to prevent <EM>C</EM> and

any clauses subsumed by it from appearing as the result of future searches;
<LI><STRONG>overgeneral.</STRONG> Constraint added to prevent <EM>C</EM>

and clauses subsuming it from appearing as the result of future searches;
<LI><STRONG>overgeneral because not E.</STRONG> <STRONG>E</STRONG> is added as a

negative example;
<LI><STRONG>overspecific.</STRONG>  <EM>C</EM> is added as a positive example;

<LI><STRONG>overspecific because E.</STRONG>  <STRONG>E</STRONG> is added as a

positive example;
<LI><STRONG>X.</STRONG>  <STRONG>X</STRONG> is any Aleph command. This can be something

like <CODE>covers</CODE> or <CODE>mode(*,has_car(+train,-car))</CODE>;
<LI><STRONG>Ctrl-d.</STRONG> Returns to Step 1.

</UL>

</OL>

<P>
Note: the command <CODE>induce_clauses/0</CODE> with the flag <CODE>interactive</CODE>
set to <CODE>true</CODE> simply performs the same function as
<CODE>induce_incremental</CODE>.


<P>
The incremental mode does not preclude the use of prior sets of examples
or background information. These are provided in the usual way (in files
with <CODE>.b</CODE>, <CODE>.f</CODE> and <CODE>.n</CODE> suffixes).
An example of using the incremental learner to construct a program for list
membership can be found in the <CODE>incremental</CODE> sub-directory in:


<P>

<H2><A ID="SEC30">Theory-level search</A></H2>
<P>
<A ID="IDX242"></A>


<P>
An adequate explanation for a set of examples
typically requires several clauses. Most ILP systems attempt
to construct such explanations one clause at a time. The procedure
is usually an iterative greedy set-covering algorithm that finds the
best single clause (one that explains or "covers" most unexplained
examples) on each iteration. While this has been shown to work
satisfactorily for most problems, it is nevertheless interesting to
consider implementations that attempt to search directly at the
"theory-level". In other words, elements of the search space 
are sets of clauses, each of which can be considered a hypothesis for
all the examples. The implementation in Aleph of this idea is
currently at a very rudimentary level, and preliminary experiments
have not demonstrated great benefits. Nevertheless, the approach,
with development, could be promising. The implementation within
Aleph is invoked by the command:



<PRE>
              induce_theory.
</PRE>

<P>
This conducts a search that moves from one set of
clauses to another. Given a clause set <EM>S</EM> local moves are
the result of the following:



<OL>
<LI>

<STRONG>Add clause.</STRONG> A clause is added to <EM>S</EM>. This
is usually a randomly selected legal clause constructed

As noted in section <A HREF="#SEC28">Randomised search methods</A>, the use of an equality predicate

<P>
Currently, <CODE>induce_cover</CODE>  starts with an initial set of
at most <EM>C</EM> clauses, where this number is specified by
setting the <CODE>clauses</CODE> parameter. Each of these are
randomly selected legal clauses. <CODE>induce_cover</CODE> then
performs theory-level search
either using as search strategy a randomised local search method (obtained
by setting the <CODE>search</CODE> parameter to <CODE>rls</CODE>: see
section <A HREF="#SEC28">Randomised search methods</A>),
or a markov chain monte carlo technique (obtained by setting
<CODE>search</CODE> to <CODE>mcmc</CODE>). The latter is untested.
The only evaluation function allowed is <CODE>accuracy</CODE>. For
theories, this is the number <CODE>(TP+TN)/(TP+TN+FP+FN)</CODE> where
<CODE>TP,TN</CODE> are are the numbers of positive and negative
examples correctly classified respectively; <CODE>FP</CODE> is the
numbers of negative examples incorrectly classified as positive; and
<CODE>FN</CODE> is the number of positive examples incorrectly classified
as positive.




<H2><A ID="SEC31">Tree-based theories</A></H2>
<P>
<A ID="IDX243"></A>


<P>
The algorithm embodied in <CODE>induce</CODE> can
be seen as the first-order equivalent of a propositional rule-learning
algorithms like Clark and Niblett's CN2. There is now a substantial body of
empirical work (done by researchers in Leuven and Freiburg) demonstrating
the utility of first-order equivalents of propositional tree-learning procedures.
Tree-based learning can be seen as a special case of theory learning
and the implementation in Aleph uses the standard recursive-partitioning
approach to construct classification, regression, class probability, or
model trees. Tree-based theory construction is invoked by the command:



<PRE>
		induce_tree.
</PRE>

<P>
The type of tree constructed is determined by setting <CODE>tree_type</CODE>
to one of: <CODE>classification</CODE>, <CODE>regression</CODE>, <CODE>class_probability</CODE>,
or <CODE>model</CODE>.
The basic procedure attempts to construct a tree to predict the output argument
in the examples. Note that the mode declarations must specify only a single
argument as output. Paths from root to leaf constitute clauses.
Tree-construction is viewed as a refinement operation: any leaf can currently
be refined (converted into a non-leaf) by extending the corresponding clause (resulting
in two new leaves). The extension is done using
Aleph's automatic refinement operator that extends clauses by a single
literal within the mode language . That is, Aleph sets <CODE>refine</CODE> to <CODE>auto</CODE>. Note
that using the automatic refinement operator means that the user has to 
ensure that all arguments that are annotated as <STRONG>#T</STRONG> in the modes contain
generative definitions for type <STRONG>T</STRONG>.  The <CODE>lookahead</CODE> option allows additions of
several literals at once. The impurity function is specified by the setting the <CODE>evalfn</CODE> parameter.
Currently for <CODE>classification</CODE> and <CODE>class_probability</CODE> trees
<CODE>evalfn</CODE> must be one of <CODE>entropy</CODE> or <CODE>gini</CODE>. For <CODE>regression</CODE>
trees the evaluation function is automatically set to <CODE>sd</CODE> (standard deviation).
For <CODE>model</CODE> trees, <CODE>evalfn</CODE> must be one of <CODE>mse</CODE> (mean square error)
or <CODE>accuracy</CODE>.
In all cases, the result is always presented a set of rules. Rules for
<CODE>class_probability</CODE> and <CODE>regression</CODE> trees make their predictions
probabilistically using the <CODE>random/2</CODE> predicate provided within Aleph.


<P>
In addition, settings for the following parameters are
relevant: <CODE>classes</CODE>, the list of classes occuring in examples
provided (for <CODE>classification</CODE> or <CODE>class_probability</CODE> trees only);
<CODE>dependent</CODE>, for the argument constituting the dependent variable in the examples;
<CODE>prune_tree</CODE>, for pruning rules from a tree; <CODE>confidence</CODE>,
for error-based pruning of rules as described by J R Quinlan in the C4.5 book;
<CODE>lookahead</CODE>, specifying the lookahead for the refinement operator to mitigate
the horizon effect from zero-gain literals; <CODE>mingain</CODE>, specifying the
minimum gain required for refinement to proceed; and <CODE>minpos</CODE> specifying
the minimum number of examples required in a leaf for refinement to proceed.


<P>
Forward pruning is achieved by the
parameters (<CODE>mingain</CODE>) and <CODE>minpos</CODE>. The former should be set to
some value greater than 0 and the latter to some value greater than 1. 
Backward pruning uses error pruning of the final clauses
in the tree by correcting error estimates obtained from the training data.
Automatic error-based pruning is achieved by setting the parameter <CODE>prune_tree</CODE>
to <CODE>auto</CODE>.
For <CODE>classification</CODE> trees the resulting procedure is identical to the one for rule
pruning described by Quinlan in C4.5: Programs for Machine Learning, Morgan Kauffmann.
For <CODE>regression</CODE> trees, error-based pruning results in corrections to the
sample standard deviation. These corrections assume normality of observed values in a leaf: the
method has been studied emprically by L. Torgo in  "A Comparative Study of Reliable Error Estimators for
Pruning Regression Trees".
Following work by F Provost and P Domingos, pruning is not employed
for class probability prediction. At this stage, there is no pruning also
for model trees.


<P>
The prediction at each `leaf' differs for each tree type. For <CODE>classification</CODE>
trees, prediction is the majority class as estimated from the examples in
the leaf; for <CODE>regression</CODE> trees prediction is
a value drawn randomly from a normal distribution with mean and standard
deviation estimated from the examples in the leaf; for <CODE>class_probability</CODE> trees
prediction is a value drawn randomly from the (Laplace corrected) discrete
distribution of classes in the leaf; and for <CODE>model</CODE> trees prediction
is achieved by a user-defined background predicate (see following).


<P>
Model trees in Aleph are constructed by examining, at each leaf, one or
more model construction predicates. These predicates are defined as part
of background knowledge, and can specify different kinds of models For
example, the predicates may be for linear regression, polynomial regression etc. for
predicting a continuous variable; a decision tree, logistic regression etc. for
predicting a nominal variable. For each kind of model, the user has
to provide a definition for a predicate that
is able to: (a) construct the model; and (b) predict using
the model constructed. The process is the same as that for lazy evaluation.
Each such predicate is specified using the <CODE>model/1</CODE> command. If several
different predicates are specified, then, at each leaf, each predicate is called
to construct a model and the predicate that constructs the best model
(evaluated using the current setting for <CODE>evalfn</CODE>) is returned. This can
be computationally intensive, but can lead to the construction of fairly
complex theories, in which different leaves can contain different kinds
of models (for example, linear regression models in one leaf and quadratic
regression models in another).


<P>
Tree-learning can be performed interactively, with the user specifying the
split to be selected. This is done by setting <CODE>interactive</CODE> to <CODE>true</CODE>
before executing the <CODE>induce_tree</CODE> command.


<P>
An example of using the tree learner
can be found in the <CODE>tree</CODE> sub-directory in:


<P>
<A HREF="http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/research/areas/machlearn/Aleph/misc/examples.zip">http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/research/areas/machlearn/Aleph/misc/examples.zip</A>




<H2><A ID="SEC32">Constraint learning</A></H2>
<P>
<A ID="IDX244"></A>


<P>
The basic Aleph algorithm constructs
definite clauses normally intended to be components of a predictive model for
data. Early ILP work (for example, in the Claudien system)
demonstrated the value of discovering all non-Horn constraints that hold in a database.
A similar functionality can be obtained within Aleph using the command:



<PRE>
		induce_constraints.
</PRE>

<P>
The implementation of these ideas in Aleph uses a naive generate-and-test strategy
to enumerate all constraints within the background knowledge (for the
mode language provided). All constraints are of the form:



<PRE>
		false:- ...
</PRE>

<P>
and are stored in the user-specified <CODE>goodfile</CODE> (the specification of this
file is mandatory for <CODE>induce_constraints</CODE> to work).
With appropriate mode settings for <CODE>false</CODE> and <CODE>not</CODE> it is possible
to identify non-Horn constraints in the same way as Claudien. 
For example given the background knowledge:



<PRE>
		male('Fred').
		female('Wilma').
	
		human('Fred').
		human('Wilma').
</PRE>

<P>
and the mode declarations: 



<PRE>
		:- modeh(1,false).

		:- modeb(*,human(-person)).
		:- modeb(1,male(+person)).
		:- modeb(1,female(+person)).
		:- modeb(1,not(male(+person))).
		:- modeb(1,not(female(+person))).
</PRE>

<P>
Aleph identifies the following constraints:



<PRE>

		false :-
   			human(A), male(A), female(A).
		false :-
   			human(A), female(A), male(A).
		false :-
   			human(A), not male(A), not female(A).
		false :-
   			human(A), not female(A), not male(A).
</PRE>

<P>
After removing redundant constraints (which Aleph does not do), these are
equivalent to the following: 



<PRE>
		false :- human(A), male(A), female(A).

		male(A) ; female(A) :- human(A).
</PRE>

<P>
The validity of these constraints can only be guaranteed if the
background knowledge is assumed to be complete and correct. To
account for incorrect statements in the background knowledge
it may sometimes be relevant to alter the <CODE>noise</CODE> setting
when obtaining constraints which now specifies the number of falsifying
substitutions tolerated. The <CODE>minacc</CODE> parameter is ignored.


<P>
An example of using the constraints learner
can be found in the <CODE>constraints</CODE> sub-directory in:


<P>

<H2><A ID="SEC33">Mode learning</A></H2>
<P>
<A ID="IDX245"></A>


<P>
The basic Aleph algorithm assumes modes will be declared by the user
which, in the past, this has been the source of some difficulty.
There has been some work (by E. McCreath
and A. Sharma, Proc of the 8th Australian
Joint Conf on AI pages 75-82, 1995)
on automatic extraction of mode and type information from the
background knowledge provided. The implementation
of these ideas in Aleph follows these ideas fairly closely and can
be invoked by the command:



<PRE>
		induce_modes.
</PRE>

<P>
Given a set of determinations, the procedure works in two parts: (i) finding
equivalence classes of types; and (ii) finding an input/output
assignment.


<P>
Unlike the McCreath and Sharma approach,
types in the same equivalence class are given the same name only if
they "overlap" significantly (the overlap of type1 with type2
is the proportion of elements of type1 that are also elements of type2).
Significantly here means an overlap at least some threshold
T (set using <CODE>typeoverlap</CODE>, with default 0.95).
Values of <CODE>typeoverlap</CODE> closer to 1.0 are more conservative, in
that they require very strong overlap before the elements are called the
same type.
Since this may not be perfect, modes are also produced
for equality statements that re-introduce co-referencing amongst
differently named types in the same equivalence class.
The user has to however explicitly include a determination declaration for
the equality predicate.


<P>
The i/o assignment is not straightforward, as we may be dealing
with non-functional definitions. The assignment sought here is one
that maximises the number of input args as this gives the
largest bottom clause. This assignment is
is sought by means of a search procedure over mode sequences.
Suppose we have a mode sequence <CODE>M = &#60;m1,m2,..m\{i-1\</CODE>&#62;} that uses the types T.
An argument of type t in mode <CODE>m\{i\</CODE>} is an input iff t overlaps
significantly (used in the same sense as earlier) with some type in T.
Otherwise the argument is an output.
The utility of each mode sequence M is f(M) = g(M) + h(M) where
g(M) is the number of input args in M; and h(M) is a (lower) estimate
of the number of input args in any mode sequence of which M is a prefix.
The search strategy adopted is a simple hill-climbing one. Note
that the procedure as implemented assumes background predicates will
be generative (which holds when the background knowledge is ground).


<P>
An example of using the mode learner
can be found in the <CODE>modes</CODE> sub-directory in:


<P>
<A HREF="http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/research/areas/machlearn/Aleph/misc/examples.zip">http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/research/areas/machlearn/Aleph/misc/examples.zip</A>




<H2><A ID="SEC34">Abductive learning</A></H2>
<P>
<A ID="IDX246"></A>


<P>
The basic Aleph algorithm assumes that the examples provided
are observations of the target predicate to be learned. There
is, in fact, nothing within the ILP framework that requires this
to be the case. For example, suppose the following was already
provided in the background knowledge:



<PRE>
                grandfather(X,Y):-
                     father(X,Z),
                     parent(Z,Y).

                parent(X,Y):-
                    father(X,Y).

                father('Fred','Jane').

                mother('Jane','Robert').
                mother('Jane','Peter').
</PRE>

<P>
then the examples:



<PRE>
                grandfather('Fred','Robert').
                grandfather('Fred','Peter').
</PRE>

<P>
are clearly not entailed by the background knowledge. Aleph would then
simply try to learn another clause for <CODE>grandfather/2</CODE>, perhaps
resulting in something like:



<PRE>
                grandfather(X,Y):-
                     father(X,Z),
                     mother(Z,Y).
</PRE>

<P>
In fact, the job would have just as easily been done, and the result more
useful, if Aleph could learn the following:



<PRE>
                parent(X,Y):-
                     mother(X,Y).
</PRE>

<P>
This requires Aleph to be able to do two things. First, given observations
of <CODE>grandfather/2</CODE> that are not entailed by the background knowledge,
generate instances of <CODE>parent/2</CODE> that will allow the observations to be 
entailed. Second, use the instances of <CODE>parent/2</CODE> that
were generated to obtain the clause for <CODE>parent/2</CODE> above. The first
of these steps requires a form of abduction. The second requires generalisation
in the form of learning. It is the combination of these two steps
that is called "Abductive Learning" here.


<P>
The basic procedure used by Aleph is a simplified variant of S. Moyle's Alecto
program. Alecto is described in some detail in S. Moyle,
"Using Theory Completion to Learn a Navigation Control Program",
Proceedings of the Twelfth International Conference on ILP (ILP2002),
S. Matwin and C.A. Sammut (Eds), LNAI 2583, pp 182-197,
2003.  Alecto does the following: for each positive example,  an
"abductive explanation" is obtained. This explanation is set of
ground atoms. The union of abductive explanations from all
positive examples is formed (this is also a set of ground atoms).
These are then generalised to give the final theory. The
ground atoms in an abductive explanation are obtained using
Yamamoto's SOLD resolution or SOLDR (Skip Ordered Linear resolution for
Definite clauses).


<P>
Currently, abductive learning is only incorporated within the
<CODE>induce</CODE> command. If <CODE>abduce</CODE> is set to <CODE>true</CODE> then
Aleph first tries to obtain the best clause for the observed predicate
(for example, the best clause for <CODE>grandfather/2</CODE>). Abductive
explanations are then generated for all predicates marked as being
abducible (see <CODE>abducible/1</CODE>) and generalisations constructed using
these. The best generalisation overall is then selected and greedy
clause identification by <CODE>induce</CODE> repeats with the
observations left. Care has to be taken to ensure that abductive
explanations are indeed ground (this can be achieved by using appropriate
type predicates within the definitions of the abducible
predicates) and limited to some maximum number (this latter
requirement is for reasons of efficiency: see setting for
<CODE>max_abducibles</CODE>).


<P>
It should be evident that abductive learning as described here implements
a restricted form of theory revision, in which revisions are restricted
to completing definitions of background predicates other than those
for which observations are provided. This assumes that the background
knowledge is correct, but incomplete. In general, if background
predicates are both incorrect and incomplete, then a more elaborate
procedure would be required.




<H2><A ID="SEC35">Feature Construction</A></H2>
<P>
<A ID="IDX247"></A>


<P>
One promising role for ILP is in the area of feature construction.
A good review of the use of ILP for this can be found in 
S. Kramer, N. Lavrac and P. Flach (2001),
<EM>Propositionalization Approaches to Relational Data Mining</EM>,
in Relational Data Mining, S. Dzeroski and N. Lavrac (eds.), Springer.


<P>
Aleph uses a simple procedure to construct boolean features. The
procedure is invoked using the <CODE>induce_features/0</CODE> command.
This is almost identical to the <CODE>induce_cover/0</CODE> command.
Recall that <CODE>induce_cover/0</CODE> uses a
a covering strategy to construct rules that explain the examples (the
slight twist being that all positive examples are retained
when evaluating clauses at any given stage).
The difference with <CODE>induce_features/0</CODE> is that
all good clauses that are found during the course of constructing such rules
are stored as new features. A feature stored by Aleph contains two
bits of information: (1) a number, that acts as a feature identifier; and (2)
a clause <CODE>(Head:-Body)</CODE>. Here <CODE>Head</CODE> is a literal that
unifies with any of the examples with the same name and arity as <CODE>Head</CODE> and
<CODE>Body</CODE> is a conjunction
of literals. The intent is that the feature is <CODE>true</CODE> for an example
if and only if the example unifies with <CODE>Head</CODE> and <CODE>Body</CODE> is
<CODE>true</CODE>. For classification problems, the user has to specify the
the dependent variable. This is done using <CODE>set(dependent,...)</CODE>.


<P>
The process of finding rules (and the corresponding features) continues until all examples
are covered by the rules found or the number of features exceeds a pre-defined upper limit
(controlled by <CODE>set(max_features,...)</CODE>).


<P>
What constitutes a "good clause"
is dictated by settings for various Aleph parameters. The following
settings are an example of some parameters that are relevant:



<PRE>
                :- set(clauselength,10).
                :- set(minacc,0.6).
                :- set(minscore,3).
                :- set(minpos,3).
                :- set(noise,50).
                :- set(nodes,5000).
                :- set(explore,true).
                :- set(max_features,20000).
</PRE>

<P>
Features found by Aleph can be shown by the <CODE>show(features)</CODE> command.
Aleph can be used to show the boolean vectors for the train and test examples
using a combination of <CODE>set(portray_examples,...)</CODE>, <CODE>features/2</CODE>
appropriate definitions for <CODE>aleph_portray/1</CODE> and <CODE>show(train_pos)</CODE>,
<CODE>show(train_neg</CODE>) etc. Here is an example of the use
of <CODE>aleph_portray/1</CODE> for examples in the training set:



<PRE>
                aleph_portray(train_pos):-
                        setting(train_pos,File),
			show_features(File,positive).
                aleph_portray(train_neg):-
                        setting(train_neg,File),
			show_features(File,negative).

                show_features(File,Class):-
                        open(File,read,Stream),
                        repeat,
			read(Stream,Example),
                        (Example = end_of_file -&#62; close(Stream);
                                write_features(Example,Class),
                                fail).

                write_features(Example,_):-
                        features(_,(Example:- Body)),
                        (Body -&#62; write(1), write(' '); write(0), write(' ')),
                        fail.
                write_features(_,Class):-
                        writeq(Class), nl.
</PRE>

<P>
If <CODE>portray_examples</CODE> is set to <CODE>true</CODE>, Aleph will 
call <CODE>aleph_portray(Term)</CODE>, when the command
<CODE>show(Term)</CODE> is executed (with <CODE>Term</CODE> being one of 
<CODE>train_pos</CODE>, <CODE>train_neg</CODE>, <CODE>test_pos</CODE> or <CODE>test_neg</CODE>).

<VAR>V</VAR> is of the form <VAR>N/A</VAR>, where the atom <VAR>N</VAR> is

<VAR>V</VAR> is of the form <VAR>N/A</VAR>, where the atom <VAR>N</VAR> is

Specifies that outputs and constants for literals with
symbol <VAR>N/A</VAR> are to be evaluated lazily during the
search. This is particularly useful if the constants required
cannot be obtained from the bottom clause constructed by using
a single example. During the search, the literal is called with
a list containing a pair of lists for each input argument
representing `positive' and `negative' substitutions obtained for
the input arguments of the literal.
These substitutions are obtained by executing the partial
clause without this literal on the positive and negative examples.
The user needs to provide a definition capable of processing a call
with a list of list-pairs in each argument, and how the outputs are
to be computed from such information.

<A ID="IDX264"></A>
<VAR>V</VAR> is of the form <VAR>N/A</VAR>, where the atom <VAR>N</VAR> is
the name of the predicate, and <VAR>A</VAR> its arity. Specifies
that predicate <VAR>N/A</VAR> will be used to construct and execute
models in the leaves of model trees (see section <A HREF="#SEC31">Tree-based theories</A>).

The discrete distribution is specified as [p1-a,p2-b,...] where "p1" represents
the probability of drawing element "a", "p2" the probability
of drawing element "b" and so on. A normal distribution
with mean "m" and standard deviation "s" is specified by

<P>
This section contains ideas and suggestions that have surfaced during the
development of Aleph and its predecessor programs. The topics themselves are
in no particular order. They are written in a somewhat stylised manner and
reflect various personal biases. They should therefore, not be
considered normative in any way.
 




<H2><A ID="SEC39">On the appropriateness of Aleph</A></H2>
<P>
<A ID="IDX288"></A>



<OL>
<LI>

There are many ILP programs. Aleph is not particularly special.
<LI>

Check whether the problem needs a relational learning program. Is it clear
that statistical programs, neural networks, Bayesian nets, tree-learners etc.
are unsuitable or insufficient?
<LI>

Aleph's emulation of other systems is at the "ideas" level.
For example, with a setting of <CODE>search</CODE> to <CODE>heuristic</CODE>, <CODE>evalfn</CODE>
to <CODE>compression</CODE>, <CODE>construct_bottom</CODE> to <CODE>saturation</CODE>, and <CODE>samplesize</CODE>
to <CODE>0</CODE>, the command <CODE>induce</CODE> will a construct a theory along the lines
of the Progol algorithm described by S. Muggleton. This is, however, no
substitute for the original. If you want an implementation of S. Muggleton's Progol algorithm
exactly as described in his paper, then Aleph is not suitable for you. Try CProgol instead.
The same comment applies to other programs listed in section <A HREF="#SEC37">Related versions and programs</A>.
<LI>

Aleph is quite flexible in that it allows customisation of
search, cost functions, output-display etc. This allows it to approximate
the functionality of many other techniques. It could also mean that it
may not be as efficient as special-purpose implementations. See also:

<P>
<A ID="IDX289"></A>



<OL>
<LI>

You may get into trouble if predicate names in the background knowledge
clash with those already used within Aleph. This may be benign
(for example, two different predicates that encode the same
relation) or malignant (with predicates that have the same name encoding quite
different things). The list of predicate names already in use can be obtained
by repeated calls to the <CODE>current_predicate(X)</CODE> goal provided by
the Prolog engine.
<LI>

It would be better if Aleph predicates were renamed, or some
modular approach was adopted. None of this is done so far.
</OL>



<H2><A ID="SEC41">On the role of the bottom clause</A></H2>
<P>
<A ID="IDX290"></A>



<OL>
<LI>

Besides it's theoretical role of anchoring one end of the search space, the
bottom clause is really useful to introduce constants (these are obtained
from the seed example), and variable co-references.
<LI>

If you are not interested in particular constants or the bottom clause introduces
too many spurious co-references, it may be better not to construct a bottom clause.
Try using the automatic refinement operator, or write your own refinement operator.
<LI>

If the bottom clause is too large (&#62; 500 literals), then simply printing it on
screen takes a long time. Turn this off with setting verbosity to <CODE>0</CODE>.
<LI>

If the bottom clause is too large (&#62; 500 literals), then you can construct it lazily
(during the search) by setting the <CODE>construct_bottom</CODE> flag to <CODE>reduction</CODE>.

<H2><A ID="SEC42">On using Aleph interactively.</A></H2>
<P>
<A ID="IDX291"></A>



<OL>
<LI>

It is always worth experimenting with Aleph before constructing
a full theory. The commands <CODE>sat/1</CODE> or <CODE>rsat/0</CODE>, followed by
the command <CODE>reduce/0</CODE> are useful for this. <CODE>sat(N)</CODE> constructs
the bottom clause for example number <CODE>N</CODE>. <CODE>rsat</CODE> constructs a
bottom clause for a randomly selected example. <CODE>reduce</CODE> does a search
for an acceptable clause.
<LI>

You can interrupt a search at any time. The command <CODE>addhyp/0</CODE> then adds
the current best clause to the theory. This has the flavour of anytime-learning.

<LI>

The <CODE>induce_incremental</CODE> command is highly interactive. It requires
the user to provide examples, and also categorise the result of searches.
This may prove quite demanding on the user, but has the flavour of
the kind of search done by a version-space algorithm.

<LI>

Setting <CODE>interactive</CODE> to <CODE>true</CODE> and calling <CODE>induce_clauses</CODE>
has the same effect as calling <CODE>induce_incremental</CODE>. Trees can
also be constructed interactively by setting <CODE>interactive</CODE> to <CODE>true</CODE> and
calling <CODE>induce_tree</CODE>.

</OL>



<H2><A ID="SEC43">On different ways of constructing a theory</A></H2>
<P>
<A ID="IDX292"></A>



<OL>
<LI>

The routine way of using <CODE>induce/0</CODE> is often sufficient.
<LI>

<CODE>induce/0</CODE>, <CODE>induce_cover/0</CODE>, <CODE>induce_max/0</CODE>, <CODE>induce_clauses/0</CODE> and
<CODE>induce_incremental/0</CODE> encode
control strategies for clause-level search.
They will use any user defined refinement
operators, search and evaluation functions, beam-width restrcitions
etc that are set. In terms of speed, <CODE>induce/0</CODE> is usually faster
than <CODE>induce_cover/0</CODE>, which in turn is faster than <CODE>induce_max/0</CODE>.
The time taken by <CODE>induce_incremental/0</CODE> is not as easily
characterisable. <CODE>induce_clauses/0</CODE> is simply <CODE>induce/0</CODE>
or <CODE>induce_incremental/0</CODE> depending on whether the flag
<CODE>interactive</CODE> is <CODE>false</CODE> or <CODE>true</CODE> respectively.
<LI>

<CODE>induce_max/0</CODE> results in a set of clauses that is invariant of
example ordering. Neither <CODE>induce_cover/0</CODE>,
<CODE>induce/0</CODE> or <CODE>induce_incremental/0</CODE>  have this
property.
<LI>

Use the T-Reduce program after <CODE>induce_max/0</CODE> or <CODE>induce_cover/0</CODE>
to obtain a compact theory for prediction.
<LI>

You can construct a theory manually by repeatedly using <CODE>sat/1</CODE> (or <CODE>rsat/0</CODE>),
<CODE>reduce/0</CODE> and <CODE>addhyp/0</CODE>.
<LI>

You can mitigate the effects of poor choice of seed example in
the saturation step
by setting the <CODE>samplesize</CODE> flag.  This sets the number of examples 
to be selected randomly by
the <CODE>induce</CODE> or <CODE>induce_cover</CODE> commands.
Each example seeds a different
search and the best clause is added to the theory.
<LI>

If you set <CODE>samplesize</CODE> to <CODE>0</CODE> examples will be selected in the order
of appearance in the positive examples file.
This will allow replication of results
without worrying about variations due to sampling.
<LI>

The <CODE>induce_tree</CODE> command will construct tree-structured theories.

The <CODE>induce_theory</CODE> command is to be used at your own peril.

<OL>

The search for a clause is implemented by a restricted
form of a general branch-and-bound algorithm.
A description of the algorithm follows. It is a slight modification
of that presented by
C.H. Papadimitriou and K. Steiglitz (1982),
<EM>Combinatorial Optimisation</EM>, Prentice-Hall, Edgewood-Cliffs, NJ.
In the code that follows, <EM>activeset</EM> contains the
set of "live" nodes at any point; the variable <EM>C</EM> is used to hold the
cost of the best complete solution at any given time.


<PRE>
<STRONG>begin</STRONG>

        remove first node k from active; (<STRONG>comment</STRONG>: k is a branching node)
        generate the children i=1,...,Nk of node k, and
            compute corresponding costs Ci and
                lower bounds on costs Li;

    <STRONG>end</STRONG>
<STRONG>end</STRONG>
</PRE>

<LI>

The algorithm above results in a search tree.
In Aleph, each node contains a clause.
<LI>

A number of choices are made in implementing a branch-and-bound algorithm for
a given problem. Here are how these are made in Aleph:
(a) <EM>Branch node</EM>. The choice of node to branch on in the activeset
is based on comparisons of a dual (primary and secondary)
search key associated with each node. The value of this key depends on the
search method and evaluation function. For example, with <CODE>search</CODE> set to <CODE>bf</CODE>
and <CODE>evalfn</CODE> set to <CODE>coverage</CODE> (the default for Aleph),
the primary and secondary keys are <CODE>-L,P-N</CODE> respectively. Here 
<CODE>L</CODE> is the number of literals in the clause, and <CODE>P,N</CODE> are the
positive and negative examples covered by the clause. This ensures clauses with
fewer literals will be chosen first. They will further be ordered on
difference in coverage;
(b) <EM>Branch set</EM>. Children are generated by refinement steps that are either
built-in (add 1 literal at a time) or user-specified. With built-in
refinement, loop detection is performed to prevent duplicate
addition of literals;
(c) <EM>Lower bounds</EM>. This
represents the lowest cost that can be achieved at this node and the sub-tree
below it.  This calculation is dependent on the search method and evaluation function.
In cases where no easy lower bound is obtainable, it is taken as <CODE>0</CODE> resulting
in minimal pruning;
(d) <EM>Restrictions</EM>. The search need not proceed until activeset is empty. It may
be terminated prematurely by setting the <CODE>nodes</CODE> parameter. Complete solutions
are taken to be ones that satisfy the language restrictions and any other
hypothesis-related constraints.

It need not be necessary to test on the entire dataset to obtain

Methods like sub-sampling or windowing can be incorporated into

is incorporated within Aleph. Windowing can

engine (available from Ashwin Srinivasan,

<H2><A ID="SEC49">On numerical reasoning with Aleph</A></H2>
<P>
<A ID="IDX298"></A>



<OL>
<LI>

There are many programs specialised to accomplish numerical reasoning.
Aleph is not one of them. Consider parametric techniques,
regression trees etc. The ILP program <STRONG>FORS</STRONG> is an example of an
ILP program particularly suited to perform regression like tasks
(see A. Karalic and I. Bratko (1997), <EM>First-Order Regression</EM>,
Machine Learning, 26:147-176). The program <STRONG>SRT</STRONG> is a first-order
variant of a regression tree builder (see S. Kramer (1996),
<EM>Structural Regression Trees</EM>, Proc. of the 13th
National Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-96)), and
the program <STRONG>Tilde</STRONG> has the capability of performing regression-like
tasks (see H. Blockeel, L. De Raedt and J. Ramon (1998),
<EM>Top-down induction of clustering trees</EM>, Proc of the 15th International
Conference on Machine Learning, pp 55-63). Aleph does 
have a simple tree-based learner that can construct regression
trees (see section <A HREF="#SEC31">Tree-based theories</A>).

<LI>

It is possible to attempt guesses at numerical constants that
add additional literals to the bottom clause. An example of
how this can be done with a predicate with multiple recall is
in the Aleph files <CODE>guess.b</CODE>, <CODE>guess.f</CODE>, and
<CODE>guess.n</CODE> in the <CODE>numbers</CODE> sub-directory in:

<A HREF="http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/research/areas/machlearn/Aleph/misc/examples.zip">http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/research/areas/machlearn/Aleph/misc/examples.zip</A>

<LI>

Guessing may not always work. The problem may then be amenable to the use
of the technique of lazy evaluation. Here an
appropriate constant in literal Li is obtained during the search
by calling a definition in background knowledge that calculates the
constant by collecting bindings from pos examples that are
entailed by the ordered clause  L0, L1, ... Li-1, and the neg
examples inconsistent with the ordered clause L0, L1, ... Li-1 (ie
the pos and neg examples "covered" by this clause).
An example of how this can be done is in the Aleph files
<CODE>ineq.b</CODE>, <CODE>ineq.f</CODE>, and <CODE>ineq.n</CODE>
in the <CODE>numbers</CODE> sub-directory in:

<A HREF="http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/research/areas/machlearn/Aleph/misc/examples.zip">http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/research/areas/machlearn/Aleph/misc/examples.zip</A>

<LI>

The technique of lazy evaluation can be used with more than one input
argument and to calculate more than one constant. With several input
arguments, values in lists of substitutions can be paired off. An example
where it is illustrated how a line can be constructed from a picking two
such substitution-pairs can be found in the Aleph files
<CODE>ineq.b</CODE>, <CODE>ineq.f</CODE>, and <CODE>ineq.n</CODE>
in the <CODE>numbers</CODE> sub-directory in:

<A HREF="http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/research/areas/machlearn/Aleph/misc/examples.zip">http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/research/areas/machlearn/Aleph/misc/examples.zip</A>

<LI>

The use of lazy evaluation, in combination with user-defined search
specifications can result in quite powerful (and complex) clauses. In the
file:

<A HREF="http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/research/areas/machlearn/Aleph/misc/mut.b">http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/research/areas/machlearn/Aleph/misc/mut.b</A>

is the background knowledge used to construct theories in a subset of
the "mutagenesis" problem. It illustrates the call to a C function to
compute linear regression, user-defined refinement operators, and a
user-defined cost function that forces clauses to be scored on mean-square
-error (rather than coverage)

<LI>

Earlier incarnations of Aleph (called P-Progol) have
been applied to a number of real-world problems.
Prominent amongst these concern the construction of structure-activity relations
for biological activity. In particular, the results for mutagenic and carcinogenic
activity have received some attention.
Also prominent has the been the use for identifying pharmacophores -- the
three-dimensional arrangement of functional groups on small molecules
that enables them to bind to drug targets.

<P>
<A ID="IDX300"></A>



<OL>
<LI>

There is often a significant advantage in combine the results of
Aleph with those of established prediction methods.
<LI>

Three ways of doing this are evident:
(a) <EM>As background knowledge.</EM> Incorporate other prediction methods as part of
the background knowledge for Aleph. An example is the use of linear
regression as a background knowledge;
(b) <EM>As new features.</EM> Incorporate the results from Aleph
into an established prediction method. An example is the conversion of Aleph
derived alerts into "indicator" variables for linear regression; and
(c) <EM>For outlier analysis.</EM> Use Aleph to explain only those instances
that are inadequately modelled by established techniques. 
An example is the use of Aleph to explain the non-linearities left
after the linear component adequately explained by regression is
removed.

<H2><A ID="SEC52">On performing closed-world specialisation with Aleph</A></H2>
<P>
<A ID="IDX301"></A>



<OL>
<LI>

Generalised Closed-World Specialisation (GCWS) is a way of obtaining
structured theories in ILP.  Given an overgeneral clause C, GCWS specialises it
by constructing automatically new "abnormality" predicates
 that encode exceptions to C, exceptions to those exceptions, etc.
<LI>

A classic example is provided by the Gregorian Calendar currently in
use in parts of the world.
From 45 B.C.E to 1581 C.E the Holy Roman
Empire subscribed to the Julian calendar commissioned by Julius
Caesar. This specified that every year that was a multiple
of $4$ would contain an intercalary day to reconcile the
calendar with a solar year (that is, one extra day would
be added).
This rule is correct up to around one part in a hundred and so up until
1582 errors could simply be treated as noise.
In 1582 C.E  Pope Gregory XIII introduced the Gregorian
calendar. The following corrections were implemented.
Every fourth year would be an intercalary year except
every hundredth year. This rule was itself to be overruled every
four hundredth year, which would be an intercalary year. As
a set of clauses the Gregorian calendar is:


<PRE>
normal(Y):-
        not(ab0(Y)).
 
ab0(Y):-
        divisible(4,Y),
        not(ab1(Y)).
 
ab1(Y):-
        divisible(100,Y),
        not(ab2(Y)).
 
ab2(Y):-
        divisible(400,Y).

</PRE>

where <CODE>normal</CODE> is a year that does not contain an intercalary day.
With background knowledge of <CODE>divisible/2</CODE> GCWS would automatically
specialise the clause:


<PRE>
normal(Y).
</PRE>

by constructing the more elaborate theory earlier. This involves
invention of the <CODE>ab0,ab1,ab2</CODE> predicates.

<LI>

See M. Bain, (1991), <EM>Experiments in non-monotonic learning</EM>, Eighth
International Conference on Machine Learning, pp 380-384, Morgan Kaufmann, CA;
and A. Srinivasan, S.H. Muggleton, and M. Bain (1992):
<EM>Distinguishing Noise from Exceptions in Non-Monotonic Learning</EM>,
Second International Workshop on ILP, for more details of GCWS.

<LI>

The way to use GCWS within Aleph is as follows. First try to learn
a clause in the standard manner (that is using the <CODE>sat</CODE> and <CODE>reduce</CODE>
commands). If no acceptable clause is found, decrease the minimum accuracy
of acceptable clauses (by setting <CODE>minacc</CODE> or <CODE>noise</CODE>). Now do the
search again. You will probably get an overgeneral clause (that is, one that
covers more negative examples than preferrable). Now use the <CODE>sphyp</CODE>
command to specialise this hypothesis. Aleph will repeatedly create
examples for new abnormality predicates and generalise them until the original
overgeneral clause does not cover any negative examples. You can then elect
to add this theory by using the <CODE>addgcws</CODE> command.

<LI>

The implementation of
GCWS within Aleph is relatively inefficient as it requires creating
new examples for the abnormality predicates on disk.
